CNN,Biden’s D-Day visit may mark the end of an American era,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/06/politics/biden-d-day-american-leadership/index.html,"The new world for which the greatest generation sacrificed in the bloody surf of the Normandy beaches is fading into history along with the last of the old soldiers. The 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings observed by President Joe Biden in France Thursday will likely be the last major decennial commemoration attended by significant numbers of veterans. Even a 19-year-old who stormed ashore in the biggest amphibious operation in history would soon be 100. This year’s memorial ceremony represents far more than a poignant farewell to surviving comrades of more than 150,000 allied troops who forged a beachhead for the liberation of Europe from Adolf Hitler’s Nazis. Presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from NATO nations are gathering at a paradoxical moment. They are unusually united but experiencing growing dread. The alliance has a new sense of mission in opposing another war started by a tyrant bent on territorial expansion — this time in Ukraine. But at no point since June 6, 1944, has the unshakable US leadership of the West and support for internationalist values been so in question. Democracy is facing its sternest test in generations from far-right populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Geopolitical empires like Russia and China are, meanwhile, resurgent and threatening to obliterate the global system dominated by Western values that has prevailed since World War II. European nations already rattled by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s constant attacks on NATO in his first term were further rocked by his recent comment that he’d let Russia do “whatever the hell they want” with allies that he regarded as failing to “pay their bills” on defense spending. The comment weakened the foundational NATO creed of mutual self-defense without which the alliance has no meaning. Some of Trump’s ex-advisers have warned that he might try to exit the alliance if he wins a second term in November. Even if Biden wins, there are growing indications that Americans’ willingness to maintain the security guarantees — even to former enemies like Germany and Japan that bought 80 years of peace — may be waning. Trump’s “America First” philosophy has taken deep root in the Republican Party that once prided itself on winning the Cold War. Some GOP figures led by the ex-president now appear to have more empathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin than liberal European democracies that the United States rebuilt after World War II. And the monthslong delay in funding Biden’s most recent aid package for Ukraine raised doubts that Washington will always stand up for democracy in Europe and against aggression by autocrats. Biden on Thursday is certain to cite an unrepayable debt owed to US, British, Canadian and other troops involved in Operation Overlord. He’ll walk among row upon row of white crosses and Stars of David shaded by pine trees and oaks overlooking Omaha Beach. This is where more than 9,000 fallen Americans from all 50 states and the District of Columbia lay at rest thousands of miles from the land they left to save foreigners they’d never met. Biden took great pleasure in traveling the world after winning the 2020 election and declaring “America is back.” He lived up to his words by wielding the most effective leadership of the Western alliance since President George H.W. Bush at the end of the Cold War. But many foreign leaders worry that Biden’s term is an interregnum of normality rather than a return to the certainty of US leadership. With his volatile temperament, transactional suspicion of alliances and idolizing of dictators, Trump’s first term turned the United States from a bulwark of stability into an unpredictable force of disruption. After a long period of denial, many in the chancelleries of Europe expect Trump to be back. Trump’s mix of isolationism and populism did not emerge in a vacuum. It was distilled from years of US military failures abroad in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and a growing belief among many Americans that the globalized world was eroding the domestic dividend of prosperity and security that flowed from World War II and was built by those who returned from the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific. A growing sense that Americans are tiring of their global role has sparked overdue debates in some European capitals about doing more to ensure the continent’s own security. Charles Kupchan, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, believes that the internal threat to the West is as great as the external one posed by US enemies. “And it’s not just Trump,” he said. “It’s also what’s happening to the political center in France, the political center in Germany, the likely gains of the far right in the upcoming EU elections. Even if Biden were to win, Americans, Europeans are asking difficult questions about American reliability.” The Normandy landings, long regarded as a triumph, marked the moment in history when the United States truly emerged as a superpower with the might and the will to make the world safe for democracy. But at the time, the risk of sending an armada across the English Channel in questionable weather to battle hardened Nazi forces was enormous. As allied forces landed on the beaches, President Franklin Roosevelt uttered a D-Day prayer over the radio. “Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity.” To begin with, fears of failure seemed justified. By the end of June 6, none of the invading forces had achieved their first-day objectives. More than 10,000 were dead, wounded or missing. The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, had prepared a message before the invasion in case of a retreat. “If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone,” he wrote. But the future president never had to take his remarks out of his wallet. In the days ahead, the allies slowly established a foothold in the northwest tip of the continent. After breaking out, they were in Paris by August and, after often bitter fighting, victory in Europe was won by May 1945. For many years after World War II, D-Day commemorations lacked the fanfare and high diplomatic and political significance they carry today. And there’s an argument that the geopolitical symbolism has become too heavy and threatens to obscure the simple courage of dwindling groups of veterans who make a pilgrimage to honor slain comrades. But French and American presidents especially have used the gatherings as a stage to renew transatlantic bonds. In an especially significant piece of statecraft this time, the Western leaders will be joined by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has billed his nation’s fight for survival after the Russian invasion as an echo of the allied battle against Hitler. Russian leaders or top officials have also attended the commemorations, at least since the end of the Cold War, in honor of the Soviet Union’s staggering losses fighting the Nazis. But Putin is now a pariah and has not been invited. This year’s event has important domestic connotations for several leaders. It will be the first of the decennial commemorations to feature Britain’s King Charles III as head of state after the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth II, a fixture in Normandy for decades. And it offers a stage for French President Emmanuel Macron and Biden, both politically weakened, to highlight their statesmanship at a moment of global turmoil. Biden will on Friday echo one of his predecessors, Ronald Reagan, who in 1984 traveled to a clifftop 100 feet high known as Pointe du Hoc, which was scaled in a daring raid by US Army Rangers on D-Day. Despite heavy losses, the Rangers seized German artillery pieces that could have caused even greater carnage of the Omaha and Utah invasion beaches. Reagan stood in front of a stone memorial shaped into the Rangers’ emblem, with his back to the Channel, surrounded by surviving veterans of the raid, and gave one of the greatest presidential speeches. “These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,” Reagan said. He later confessed to his diary that he was so moved it was tough to get the words out. The speech came at a particularly contentious moment in the Cold War with tensions high between Washington and the Soviet Union. But Reagan’s clarion call for freedom may have had an impact. Less than a year later, Mikhail Gorbachev became secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party and set in motion reforms and nuclear arms negotiations that led to the end of the Cold War. Biden, like the 40th president, is facing concerns about his age in his reelection year. And on Friday he will visit the same clifftop to make a similar call to save democracy. Reagan’s Pointe du Hoc speech is not just remarkable for its poetry. Forty years on, it’s stunningly relevant to a new political era. And it’s equally striking how far the Republican Party has traveled from the man who once personified it to the anti-democratic American Firstism of its current hero. “We in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost,” Reagan said. “We’ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.” He went on: “We are bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs. We’re bound by reality. The strength of America’s allies is vital to the United States, and the American security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of Europe’s democracies. We were with you then; we are with you now. Your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny.” In 1984, Reagan could offer that promise without fear of contradiction. Biden cannot do the same in 2024.",
CNN,King Charles travels to mark D-Day anniversary while Prince William takes greater role,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/06/europe/prince-william-king-charles-d-day-anniversary-intl/index.html,"Britain’s King Charles III has embarked on his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer, traveling across the English Channel for commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day Landings in Normandy. Nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed on five stretches of the German-occupied Normandy coastline on June 6, 1944. Operation Overlord – as D-Day was codenamed – remains, to this day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, ﻿and was a crucial turning point in defeating the Nazis in World War II. Omaha Beach was the deadliest of the landing sites as German forces were entrenched in fortified cliff positions above allowing them to fire on the first waves of US soldiers as they reached the shore. Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on D-Day. Exact figures of German casualties on the day are not known, however it has been estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 service personnel. On Thursday morning, King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion’s commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Charles is patron of both the Royal British Legion and Normandy Memorial Trust. The King urged allies to “recall lessons that come to us again and again,” while addressing D-Day veterans. “How fortunate we were and the entire free world that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test,” Charles said, adding that his grandfather, King George VI, described the events of D-Day as “the supreme test.” Charles reflected on the qualities of the armed forces involved, saying they “carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination.” He also used the speech to reflect on the past through the lens of the present, saying: “We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades. Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.” Charles also spoke in French, thanking the people of France for their “warmth” and “generosity” towards D-Day veterans, which he said is the “most moving and memorable part of these anniversaries.” While the King traveled to France for commemorations, he is not expected to join world leaders - including Macron and his US counterpart Joe Biden – later Thursday as they gather at Omaha Beach to honor troops for their bravery and sacrifice eight decades ago. Instead, Prince William will represent Britain’s royal family at the international ceremony at Omaha Beach. The optics of seeing the Prince of Wales instead of his father will not be lost on those within the royal household, as well as royal-watchers. Nonetheless, CNN understands that it wasn’t a deliberate orchestration. Seeing the future monarch in the company of other heads of state is a powerful visual and speaks to the longer transition which will prepare the public for King William V’s reign. King Charles also only recently returned to public engagements after getting the green light from his doctors who were “encouraged” by his progress. He is continuing to receive treatment and each engagement the 75-year-old sovereign carries out is being reviewed and adapted where necessary by his medical team to ensure his continued recovery. That simple reason of following medical advice appears to be behind the King’s absence at the international commemoration on Thursday afternoon. A royal source told CNN that it was considered a step too far at this stage but that the monarch was delighted the Prince of Wales was representing the nation. William, 42, has been an ever-present fixture as the royal family marked the D-Day anniversary in recent days. Earlier Thursday, the heir to the British throne paid tribute at the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre in Courseulles-Sur-Mer, where he joined veterans as well as current serving personnel before making a speech and laying a wreath. A day earlier, William had joined Charles and Camilla at the UK’s national commemorative event in Portsmouth. The city on England’s south coast was one of the places Allied troops sailed from before the Normandy landings. William paid tribute to veterans who “came from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny. Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens.” Meanwhile, in his own moving speech, King Charles told crowds that “the stories of courage, resilience and solidarity” must not be forgotten and that they are a reminder “of what we owe to that great wartime generation.” Charles added: “It is our duty to ensure that we, and future generations, do not forget their service and their sacrifice.”",

CNN,There’s one world leader who won’t be at commemorations,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/05/opinions/d-day-80th-anniversary-ukraine-russia-ghitis/index.html,"Parachutes flapped open in midair over France this week as US paratroopers leaped out of World War II-era military planes, launching the start of solemn commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, a week that will bring dozens of world leaders, including President Joe Biden, for events that will be rich in symbolism and resonant with current times. For decades, the United States, its allies and others have come together to remember the June 6, 1944, US-led landing in Normandy, the largest seaborne invasion in history and the pivotal final stage of the Allied push to defeat Nazi Germany’s devastating, genocidal campaign of conquest. The ceremonies, as is tradition, honor those who fought and died in World War II, and reaffirm a commitment to learn the lessons of history. But what exactly are those lessons, and how exactly will world leaders turn that commitment into reality? That nebulous pledge to prevent history from repeating itself has become starkly concrete as Russian forces seek to subjugate Ukraine in the first major land war in Europe since World War II. In France this week, Biden will join some 25 prime ministers and presidents — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will attend; Russia’s Vladimir Putin has not been invited — marking the occasion. In a remarkable twist, history also echoes in the possibly next president of the United States, Donald Trump, who has revived the term “America First,” used in the 1930s and ’40s by Americans who wanted the US to stand back, even as Hitler launched a war to conquer Europe. As he foreshadows potentially drastic changes in the US approach to Europe’s defense and to the war in Ukraine, Trump is raising “existential” anxiety among US allies. During Biden’s time in France, he will speak “about the importance of defending freedom and democracy,” and discuss “a wide range of global challenges.” Topping the agenda: how to help Ukraine. The host, French President Emmanuel Macron, has emerged as one of the most outspoken advocates of upgrading support for Kyiv, contrasting with Biden’s assertive but more cautious approach. Macron’s transformation has been remarkable. In the weeks leading up to Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of its neighbor, he traveled to Moscow, meeting with Putin at his colossally long Covid-19-distancing table, in search of a way to prevent the conflagration. Those who thought Macron was being too deferential to the Russian dictator had extra reason to cringe when, months after Russian forces crossed into Ukraine, Macron declared that “we must not humiliate Russia.” And all as Russia’s plan to score a swift victory was unraveling and Biden was reaffirming his unwavering support for Kyiv. In the intervening years, Macron’s stance has hardened as his view of the risk Russia poses to Europe and the West has darkened. In April, he warned, “Our Europe is mortal; it can die,” partly as a result of Russia’s aggression. Earlier this year, he jolted Europeans when he declared that nothing can be ruled out, not even sending Western troops to Ukraine, adding “We will do anything we can to prevent Russia from winning.” Germany rejected the idea, as did others. But apparently Macron was doing more than trying to stiffen allies’ spines. According to the Financial Times, this week, with Biden and Zelensky in France, Macron will announce that European troops will, in fact, soon go to Ukraine. One of the most pressing decisions faced by Ukraine’s backers now is how much freedom to give Kyiv to strike Russian targets with the weapons they provide. The dilemma embodies one of the two fears driving Western support. On one hand, Europe and the United States fear that if Russia wins, Putin will continue pushing to conquer territories that belonged not just to the Soviet Union but also to the Russian Empire. That’s a concern searingly underscored by the lessons of World War II, when Hitler was allowed to slice off a piece of Czechoslovakia, then moved into Poland and barreled across Europe until he was finally stopped. The worry is palpable among Russia’s neighbors and is one of the reasons Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told his people to prepare, calling this time a “prewar era.” On the other hand, the fear is that giving Ukraine carte blanche to strike at Russia risks escalating the conflict into one between nuclear-armed Russia and nuclear-armed NATO, perhaps World War III. Can the war be contained and Russia defeated? Zelensky has been imploring Kyiv’s friends to let Ukraine use their arms to strike inside Russia. While allies discussed the issue, Russian forces, facing little risk, struck a department store in Kharkiv, not far from the Russian border, killing 18 people. “Please give us the permission” to use the weapons for preventing those attacks, Zelensky implored allies. He won’t use them without permission, for fear of losing Western support. The West remains divided on the issue. Biden has loosened some of the restrictions. Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz want them loosened even more, though still restricted. Finland and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg say Ukraine’s friends are forcing it to fight with one hand tied behind its back. The D-Day anniversary meetings are sure to include discussions about how to stop Russia, and the question of whether Russia, if facing a more empowered Ukraine, would really face off directly with the West, as Putin threatens. As they gaze on the once blood-drenched beaches of Normandy, world leaders should consider the lessons of World War II, and how to apply them today. America Firsters helped persuade the United States to stay out of combat in Europe until the war came to the US at Pearl Harbor. Eventually, 16.4 million Americans served in the military during World War II, more than 10% of the population. Some 29,000 Americans died in the Normandy invasion, in a war that engulfed 50 countries, a catastrophe that would kill more than 70 million people, one of every 30 people who were alive when it started. The conflicts are not the same; the ideologies and the leaders are different. And yet, the beaches of Normandy resonate with the lessons of that terrible history; world leaders should listen closely.",

CNN,Famous scenic waterfall in China goes viral after video appears to show water coming from pipe,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/06/05/travel/china-yuntai-park-waterfall-water-pipe-intl-scli/index.html,"A famous waterfall in China has drawn even more attention than usual – after a video revealed that its majestic falls may be artificially supplied by a water pipe. The Yuntai Waterfall is located in Yuntai Mountain Park, a major tourist attraction in China’s north-central Henan province. The park has an AAAAA rating – the highest given to a tourist attraction by the country’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism. But the source of the water, described by the park’s website as “like the Milky Way flying down,” has come under scrutiny. A video posted on Chinese social media this week appears to show a pipe supplying water to the 314-meter-tall (1,030-foot) falls – suggesting their source may not be as all-natural as visitors had been led to believe. Yuntai Mountain Park’s management responded to the video, explaining how changes in the dry season necessitated the extra boost to the falls. “(The waterfall) cannot guarantee to meet the public in its most beautiful appearance due to season changes,” they said, adding that the waterfall underwent “a tiny improvement during dry season.” The park’s management also expressed gratitude for the attention, promising that the waterfall would greet guests this summer in its “most perfect and most natural form.” While the video shocked many people in China, others on social media applauded the park’s response. “The source of a waterfall is not what people came to see anyway, I don’t think it counts as lying to the public” said one Weibo user. “You are there to see a peacock flaunting his tail, not to focus on the peacock’s butt,” said another. Yuntai is not the first waterfall in China to need a little extra help. The country’s monsoon climate makes it a challenge to keep the water flowing during dry seasons, which see less rainfall. The Huangguoshu Waterfall, located in China’s southwestern Guizhou province also suffered in the dry season. In 2004, a dam was built to make sure it would continue to flow. At the time, the province applauded the dam, saying it would “put an end to the history of Huangguoshu Waterfall drying up.”",
BBC,"Myanmar soldiers cut off tattoos and gave detainees urine to drink, witnesses tell BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckmm6jep6l7o,"At least 50 people were killed by Myanmar soldiers in a raid on a village in Rakhine State last week, say local residents and opposition forces. Warning: You may find some of the details in this piece disturbing Eyewitnesses told the BBC the village was subjected to two-and-half days of terror as soldiers blindfolded and beat them up, poured burning petrol on their skin and forced some of them to drink their urine. They were looking for supporters of the Arakan Army (AA), which has become one of the most effective ethnic fighting forces in Myanmar. Fifty-one people aged between 15 and 70 were ""violently tortured and killed"", the National Unity Government (NUG), representing the ousted civilian government, said in a statement. The AA estimated the death toll to be more than 70 people. The ruling military council, or junta, has denied the accusations, which would amount to one of the worst atrocities committed in the three year-old Myanmar civil war. “They asked the men if the AA was in this village,” one woman told the BBC. “Whatever answer they gave, whether they said AA was there or it wasn’t, or they didn’t know, the soldiers hit them."" In just six months, the AA has swept through most of Rakhine State, forcing the military to keep retreating. It ended a ceasefire with the army last year and joined ethnic insurgents in other parts of the country in a combined operation aimed at overthrowing the junta which seized power in February 2021. ""I saw with my own eyes my husband being taken away in a military vehicle. My son was separated from both of us, and I don't know where he is. Now I don't know if my son and husband are alive or dead,"" the woman told the BBC. The names of witnesses are not being used to protect them. They told the BBC that everyone in the village, which has just over 1,000 households, were kept out  in the open for two days, under the sun, with little to eat or drink, while dozens of men were tied, blindfolded and some taken away in trucks for further interrogation. Many are yet to return. ""They were so thirsty, standing all day in the sun, and begged for water. But the soldiers urinated in water bottles and gave them to the men,"" the woman told the BBC. She said she heard ""lots of gunshots"", but didn't see who was shot ""because we had to keep our heads down"". ""I didn't dare to look. They called someone standing near me. Then I heard a gunshot. He never came back.'' She was crying throughout because she was worried about her husband and son: ""I didn't know if they were dead or alive. I was praying for them, ‘Buddha, please save them’."" Survivors say they could hear soldiers asking for shovels to bury the bodies. They say some were clearly drunk. More than 100 soldiers are believed to have raided the village Byai Phyu, which is just outside the state capital of Sittwe, on Wednesday. Sittwe, a city with around 200,000 inhabitants, a large port and airport, is one of the Burmese army's few remaining strongholds. But the insurgents are close, and enjoy the sympathy of much of the ethnic Rakhine population. Men who had tattoos showing support for the AA were singled out for especially harsh treatment, locals said. One eyewitness said the soldiers cut out the tattooed skin, poured petrol onto it and set it alight. Another eyewitness recalled an army officer telling the villagers he had come from the fighting in northern Shan State, where the military suffered heavy losses late last year, to take his revenge on them. Losing Rakhine State on the border with Bangladesh would be one of the greatest humiliations ever suffered by the armed forces, which have dominated Myanmar since independence in 1948. On Friday those left standing in the marketplace, mostly women, children and the elderly,  were ordered to gather a few things and leave. They said the soldiers had already looted anything valuable, like gold, jewellery or solar panels from their homes. The locals were initially taken to a stadium in Sittwe, but most have moved to seek shelter in Buddhist monasteries in the city. The BBC understands that the army still controls Byai Phyu, and no-one is being allowed back. There are reports that much of the village has been burned down. The NUG has promised to bring those responsible for war crimes in Byai Phyu to justice. The AA also accused what it calls ""the fascist military council"" of ""vicious cruelty"", and of gang-raping some of the women in Byai Phyu. The junta has denied all allegations of torture, stating that they were only conducting ""peace and security"" measures in the village after spotting sandbag bunkers there. It accuses the Arakan Army of launching drone strikes from that area of Sittwe. The isolation of Rakhine State and the intensity of the conflict make any independent investigation of what happened in Byai Phyu impossible for the foreseeable future. But the accounts given by survivors are an ominous warning of what could happen elsewhere in Myanmar as the military continues to lose ground to an increasingly confident and capable armed opposition movement.

BBC,Why Canadians are angry with their biggest supermarket,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11ywyg6p0o,"Canada is searching for an international grocer to enter its domestic market, after years of anger from shoppers over high food prices, much of it directed at one of the big players. But would an Aldi or a Lidl solve the problem? Late last year, Emily Johnson took to Reddit to share her frustration with how expensive food in Canada has become. She fixated on one grocer in particular: Loblaw, the dominant food retailer in Canada, boasting nearly 2,500 stores. Her Reddit group - named LoblawsIsOutofControl - was filled with photos of grocery items for sale at seemingly egregious prices, like C$40 ($29.36; £23.06) for 1.4 kilograms of chicken. Soon after, Ms Johnson and others banded together to launch a nation-wide boycott against Loblaw, saying they were fed up with the disparity between rising food prices and record profits. As anger grew, the grocer’s former president Galen Weston, who has defended the profits, became the de facto face of food inflation in Canada, thanks to his regular appearances in Loblaw commercials and his annual reported salary of C$8.4m. Some even began selling T-shirts featuring a spoof “Roblaw$” logo, which were met with copyright infringement complaints from the grocer. The boycott, which began in May and is set to continue indefinitely, has since sparked a national conversation on how groceries in Canada are priced, and why a company like Loblaw continues to be profitable as more Canadians struggle to afford food. It has also ignited political pressure and scrutiny on the grocery practices of not just Loblaw, but other major grocers in the country. “Groceries did not used to be such an issue but the prices have skyrocketed this past year so we’re going without anything frivolous,” Terra Suffel, a 49-year-old single mother of two living in Toronto, told the BBC. A C$200 shopping spree used to feed Ms Stuffel and her children for the entire week, she said. Now it barely covers lunch ingredients and much-needed pantry items. “We can’t really afford much meat and our main protein is now eggs,” she said, adding that she, too, is boycotting Loblaw. In response to frustrated Canadians like her, Canada’s federal innovation minister has since taken several overseas trips to woo an international grocer to set up shop in Canada, in an attempt to increase competition and therefore drive down food prices. But experts say that any foreign grocer looking to enter Canada’s market faces an uphill battle to distinguish itself from existing players, and that the country’s unaffordability crisis may require a more complex fix. Loblaw has responded to the boycott by saying they remain committed to be the “retailer of choice” for Canadians. In a statement to the BBC, the company added that it was doing what it could to fight inflation and plans on opening more discount stores to make affordable food more accessible. Like many other countries, Canadians saw the cost of living go up after the Covid-19 pandemic thanks to supply-chain issues and labour shortages. Although food inflation in Canada peaked at a lower mark, 11.4%, than in the UK and US, according to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the overall figure does not tell the whole story. A price comparison between the three countries of some everyday items suggests Canada is indeed more expensive for some of those regular shopping basket contents. Canadians are also grappling with a currency that is plummeting in value compared to the US dollar, which has impacted both the price of food imported from the US, as well as Canadians’ overall purchasing power. Rising interest rates, coupled with higher rent and home prices, have also pinched the wallets of many in Canada. “People are feeling (the rising cost of food) because they are also feeling the rise of mortgage payments and other things,” said Jordan LeBel, a marketing professor with expertise in the food industry at Concordia University in Montreal.  Another issue is the heavily consolidated nature of Canada’s grocery market, said Prof LeBel. The country’s industry is dominated by three large companies: Loblaw (which operates Loblaw's stores), Empire (which operates Sobeys stores) and Metro. They make up nearly 60% of the grocery market share while Walmart and Costco make up much of the rest. In comparison, the US grocery market features more regional players. And while Walmart is by far the most popular chain across the country, there are more than a dozen other grocers meaningfully competing with it. Similarly, the UK’s market is also diverse, with a total of 14 businesses turning over more than £1bn in groceries sales per year. Prof LeBel said the Loblaw boycott is a signal from Canadians who are fed-up with the lack of choice and the country’s grocery behemoths, who lack an incentive to meaningfully tackle rising food costs. Francois-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s minister of innovation, science and industry, has been tight-lipped on which international grocers he has been trying to court. But government documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal in April have named 12 potential stores, including Germany’s Aldi and Lidl, France’s Les Mousquetaires, and other companies from Turkey, Spain and Portugal. Discount supermarket chain Aldi already has nearly 2,400 stores in the US. It is also the UK’s fourth largest supermarket. Its chief competitor Lidl has a footprint in the UK and the US as well, though a smaller one than Aldi. Despite their popularity in other countries, retail experts say entering the Canadian market comes with its own unique set of challenges. “The classic mistake all foreign retailers make when coming to Canada is that they think it is the 51st US state,” said Amarinder Singh, a senior director at consulting firm Kantar. In reality, Canadian shoppers are very different, he said. Their needs vary regionally, he said, whether they live in Atlantic Canada or in British Columbia, or whether they call a major metropolitan city like Toronto home. Canada is also a highly multicultural country with 20% born elsewhere and a national grocer must target them to find success, Mr Singh said. Another factor to consider is that Loblaw’s strong loyalty points programme covers 40% of Canada’s entire population. “The issue is how you engage the shoppers, and how you steal the share from the Loblaws and Sobeys and Metros of the world, who have such a strong grasp on this market,” said Mr Singh. Some have said the minister’s international tour is a bit of political theatre ahead of a consequential election for Canadians where the ruling Liberal Party is significantly lagging in the polls. “Going after a big player, you have meetings, photo ops - it looks like you’re doing something,” Prof LeBel said. A spokesperson from Minister Champagne’s office, Riyadh Nazerally, confirmed to the BBC that he has spoken to foreign retailers about “possible investments in Canada”, but no further details. Canada is working on other measures, like reforming its Competition Act to make it more friendly to new entrants, he added. Prof LeBel said he believes the government should also focus on building up already-existing regional players and small, local grocers. Experts have said that the impact of the boycott on Loblaw is likely limited. Local, independent grocers around the country, however, appear to be benefiting, with some seeing a significant boost in traffic and sales since the beginning of May. Supporting local players, Prof LeBel said, goes a long way in building the local economy and the fabric of a community, while improving competition in the market. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBC,‘Cold lava’ floods Philippines village after eruption,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c3gg5g0z4g6o,"Footage shows rivers of cold lava following an ‘explosive eruption’ at Mt Kanlaon on Monday. The eruption sent a plume of ash kilometres into the sky, and caused dozens of flights to be cancelled and hundreds of people to be evacuated. Authorities said further eruptions were possible. Cold lava is a mixture of volcanic material and pebbles which flows down the slope of a volcano in the rain. The phrase 'cold lava' is a translation of the term ""lahar"" in Indonesian and Tagalog. It flows similarly to wet concrete and can travel quickly. Copyright 2024 BBC.

BBC,Putin warns Russia could provide weapons to strike West,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn44r9zjnpjo,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Moscow could arm countries with a view to attacking Western targets. Mr Putin made the statement while criticising the West's delivery of long-range weapons to Ukraine. Several countries including the United States have given Ukraine the green light to strike targets inside Russia. Such action could lead to “very serious problems"", Mr Putin told foreign reporters. ""If someone thinks it is possible to supply such weapons to a war zone to attack our territory and create problems for us, why don't we have the right to supply weapons of the same class to regions of the world where there will be strikes on sensitive facilities of those countries?"" the Russian president said. ""That is, the response can be asymmetric. We will think about it."" He did not specify which countries Moscow could supply weapons to. Mr Putin singled out Germany, which recently told Ukraine it was free to hit targets inside Russia with long-range German-made weapons. ""When they say that there will be more missiles which will hit targets on Russian territory, this definitively destroys Russian-German relations,"" Mr Putin said. US President Joe Biden has given Ukraine permission to use American-supplied weapons to strike targets in Russia, but only near the Kharkiv region. The White House has said Ukraine cannot use long-range ATACMS missiles on Russian soil. Ukraine has used US weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, a US senator and a Western official told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Fierce fighting has been raging north-east of Kharkiv since a new Russian push across Ukraine's northern border. Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, is just 30km (18 miles) from the border. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has said it is up to Ukraine to decide how to use British weapons and insisted it has the right to strike targets on Russian territory. Ukraine says North Korean missiles are being used inside Ukrainian territory, and Western intelligence agencies say Russia has been using Iranian-made drones in the conflict. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Mr Putin was speaking to foreign journalists at the annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum. He also warned that the West was wrong to assume that Moscow would never use nuclear weapons. ""For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,"" Mr Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine. ""We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone's actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. ""This should not be taken lightly, superficially."" Mr Putin also dismissed the idea that Russia has plans to attack Nato territory. ""You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You're only hurting yourself with this, you know?"" Mr Putin said. ""They thought that Russia wanted to attack Nato. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish."" Copyright 2024 BBC.
