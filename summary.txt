Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned Hezbollah of the possibility of "all-out war" after the militant group released a video allegedly showing Israeli military and civilian locations, including sites in Haifa. The tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have been escalating, with both sides engaging in cross-border attacks. CNN analysis revealed that the drone footage was geolocated in sensitive areas around Haifa, indicating an extended surveillance mission. Israel has approved operational plans for a potential offensive in Lebanon, while Hezbollah continues its attacks on northern Israel. This comes as the US approves the sale of small armed drones and missiles to Taiwan, aiming to enhance its military capabilities amidst increasing pressure from China. The sale includes precision-guided missiles used in the Ukraine conflict. This news follows the arraignment of singer Justin Timberlake on a charge of driving while intoxicated in New York. Timberlake was released without bail and is set to appear in court virtually in July. The singer, currently on tour, recently shared a Father's Day tribute to his sons on Instagram.
